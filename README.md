# josebalius's Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles (terminal / editor configuration) for use with GitHub Codespaces and local development environments.

## How to use these dotfiles

To use these dotfiles:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run the `install.sh` script to set up the configurations
3. Restart your terminal or create a new codespace to see the changes
4. üçæ

## What's in here?

Just some blank configuration files for popular Text User Interface (TUI) apps that folks may want to use for development in codespaces and a script to put them in the right place.

This supports the following tools:

* Tmux
* Screen
* Vim
* Emacs

## Vim Plugins

This repo uses the wonderful [Vim Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) tool to manage vim plugins. If you'd like to add plugins, simply add them between the opening and closing plug statements in the `vimrc` file.
