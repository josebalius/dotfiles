## What's in here?

Just some blank configuration files for popular Text User Interface (TUI) apps that folks may want to use for development in codespaces and a script to put them in the right place.

This supports the following tools:

* Tmux
* Screen

* Emacs

## Vim Plugins

This repo uses the wonderful [Vim Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) tool to manage vim plugins. If you'd like to add plugins, simply add them between the opening and closing plug statements in the `vimrc` file.
